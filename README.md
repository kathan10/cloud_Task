## Documentation

The task application built with React.js and the MERN stack is a web application that allows users to manage and organize tasks. It provides features such as creating new tasks, viewing existing tasks, updating task details, and marking tasks as completed or deleting them.

The MERN stack, consisting of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, provides a robust foundation for building the application. MongoDB serves as the database for storing task information, while Express.js handles the server-side logic and API endpoints. React.js is responsible for the user interface, allowing for a dynamic and interactive task management experience. Node.js powers the server-side environment.

The application leverages the power of React.js components to create a modular and reusable structure. Users can easily add, edit, and delete tasks using intuitive user interfaces. The application communicates with the server through API requests, allowing for real-time updates and synchronization of task data.

Overall, the task application built with React.js and the MERN stack offers a seamless and efficient way to manage tasks, helping users stay organized and productive.
